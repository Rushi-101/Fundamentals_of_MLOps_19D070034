Q1. **AIOps** :
Artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) is an umbrella term for the use of big data analytics, machine learning (ML) and other artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to automate the identification and resolution of common information technology (IT) issues. The systems, services and applications in a large enterprise produce immense volumes of log and performance data. AIOps uses this data to monitor assets and gain visibility into dependencies without and outside of IT systems.

MLOps refers to using DevOps to bring a machine learning solution to production. 

AIOps allows companies to bring machine learning and AI to bear, solving Ops challenges, such as capacity management and reliability. AIOps also increases automation, already an essential part of DevOps.

While MLOps goal is bridging the gap between data scientists and operation teams, therefore between ML model building and their execution, AIOps focuses on automating incidents management and intelligent root cause analysis.

AIOps is about increased efficiency in IT operations, achieved by automating incident/management  diagnostics and intelligently finding the root cause through machine learning. By sifting through the noise generated by monitoring systems and reducing the false positives, these solutions present technical teams with high quality information that is easy to understand, so that they can get to work on a resolution.

MLOps, on the other hand, focuses on creating an automated pipeline for bringing machine learning models into production. It looks to overcome the disconnect between data science or data ops teams and infrastructure teams, to get models into production faster and more often. Importantly – and in contrast to AIOps – MLOps doesn’t directly refer to a machine learning capability per se, with algorithms processing data. Rather, it’s a way to manage and streamline the building, deployment and maintenance of those algorithms

Q2. The linear regression model forces the prediction to be a linear combination of features, which is both its greatest strength and its greatest limitation. Linearity leads to interpretable models. Linear effects are easy to quantify and describe. They are additive, so it is easy to separate the effects.

Interpretability means that a human can understand the cause of the decision. In linear regression we can use the weights to find out which features are the most important, these are the features with the highest weight. If, for one record, we add one to a feature value while keeping the others the same the prediction will increase by the weight of the feature.

Interpretable models are models who explain themselves. A model has more interpretability than another one if its decisions are easier for a human to comprehend. Some models are so complex and are internally structured in such a way that it’s almost impossible to understand how they reached their final results.

The simplicity and straightforward approach of Linear regression models turns them into an ideal tool to approach different problems. We can use Linear Regression models to analyze how salaries in a given place depend on features like experience, level of education, role, city they work in, and so on. Similarly, we can analyze if real estate prices depend on factors such as their areas, numbers of bedrooms, or distances to the city center.
